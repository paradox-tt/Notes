Dear community,

Having had the opportunity to review feedback from both sides I would like to provide some further feedback reflecting my personal views.

>The Wagmedia team embarked on an experiment to Solve the Dotsama information distribution problem. The team plans to achieve this by providing incentives to individual participants, to create comprehensive, useful and inspiring content. 

This is no small undertaking. Their initiative is to be praised and this is a prime example of community-originated activity that the Treasury should seek to support.

It is in my opinion that Wagmedia has done a good job of:

1.  Assembling teams to produce community generated content
2.  Developing an agile system of rewarding content

My view is further influenced by both concerns and **positive attributes** raised by some members of the community. These are, by title below:

1.  Capital efficiency
2.  Quality of content
3.  Market reach
4.  Centralization of authority
5.  Code of Conduct
6.  Management of funds
7.  Effects on the wider market
   
At the onset of community discussion, my initial concerns surrounded the sheer size of spending allocations. The team requested 25,000 KSM /6 months, implying a 50,000 KSM annual budget. Pro-rating 2022 inflation earnings, Kusama's treasury earns about 205,000 KSM with 41,600 KSM burnt annually. Considering that there are many other areas of treasury expenditure, **a 50,000 KSM annual budget for a single marketing initiative – albeit an important one - is in my view not sustainable**.

I believe there should be a budget allocation for community generated content. Wagmedia is the only current contender and a pioneer in the space. If any group has earned the right to fulfill this important role, it is Wagmedia.

I also believe, however,  that there are some shortcomings with Wagmedia's current proposal and I would like to address some of these and conclude with a suggestion.

The foregoing are my general thoughts after independent reviews and following up on community feedback. I haven't reviewed every rewarded item, but I am confident with my statements.  Please also note that just because I highlight areas for improvement, it **DOES NOT** mean that I am anti-Wagmedia or against the proposal in principle.


### 1) Capital efficiency

The team takes a more collaborative approach to reviewing spending proposals than voting on tips. There are views that pricing in many cases are higher than market rates, in some cases 3-4x.  I am inclined to agree.

Tips are rewarded liberally, the magnitude of each reward is smaller but the numbers tally to a large expenditure.  Tips based content comprises about [66%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnpsO-Bfyko&t=412s&ab_channel=TheKusamarian) of Wagmedia's expenditure.

It would be good to analyze empirical data on the topic which I believe is forthcoming.

### 2) Quality of Content

The quality of review and guidance for spending proposals is notably higher than that exerted for tips. 

I agree with community sentiment that the quality of some tips leave a lot to be desired and if the Wagmedia team is entrusted with treasury funds, then the team should also have the (sometimes difficult) task of saying “no” to tips for content below their standards.  

How many tip proposals were rejected in Q1/Q2 for example?


### 3) Market Reach

Content generated from spending proposals is noticeably higher in terms of quality but even so lacks market reach. This is an overall concern that I believe is in-part related to a deficient strategy to determine the right items to be funded. 

As it relates to dubbing, for example, is a 2017 video by Rob Habermaier on interoperability required or is it now superseded? This is just one example but it speaks to a gap in the strategy/philosophy.

In the case of tips, some items were rewarded with < 10 views. I agree that marketing outreach takes time, but content without viewers – or a clear path to viewers over a relevant time horizon – is simply not valuable.

### 4) Centralization of authority

Spending proposals appear to be reviewed by a team whereas tips are rewarded by **a single director** per genre. Considering that there are no quotas or explicit standards involved, a single individual can have spend authority of significant amounts of funds. At least internally within Wagmedia, there should be accountability for the use/value of these tips – and then reporting to the Treasury of the conclusions.

### 5) Code of conduct

A view was shared that recipients of bounty funds may be perceived as official voices of the network. There was another concern raised that a funded series spoke negatively towards their project citing incorrect facts.

This is a difficult task for any media enterprise – especially one generating/curating content at the frequency of Wagmedia. While I believe that honest mistakes are understandable, I believe that there should be:

- A documented disclaimer to disassociate the views expressed by the presenter with the relay-chain/parity/w3f
- Code of conduct - There should be standards that prevent using derogatory slurs, inflammatory comments and reporting on nonfactual information.
- A mechanism for submitting complaints, a method for their evaluation and establishing penalties.
- An internal process at Wagmedia for at least a self-attestation to the foregoing by a submitting content producer

I believe these should be industry standards that one can copy/paste. The goal is not to censor but to make every effort to keep content supported by Treasury to a professional level of reporting.


### 6) Management of funds

- Funding disbursed from the treasury should be sent directly to contributors as KSM and not via De-Fi based chains. If a user has a particular need for De-Fi they should satisfy this themselves, and content proposals should not be repurposed into investment proposals
- No expectation should be created that the treasury should be responsible for paying any items that are deemed "pending". As with any budget allocation, KSM allocations should have ceased when bounty funding was depleted unless and until another proposal is approved by Treasury.
- It would be good for the community to also see the payments received broken down by individual. If this information is available, please publish or direct me to it.



### 7) Effects on the wider market

Wagmedia's use of treasury funds to pay premium prices for work with virtually no barriers to entry has an impact on the wider market. Content creators may now drive price inflation and they may not be encouraged to fill positions on dotjobs.com. This can have the exact opposite of the intended effect, depriving parachain teams of resources or at the very least creating an artificially inflated cost structure. 

While treasury should absolutely be supporting content creators, it should not create price inflation that is insupportable in the long term.


### Suggestions

The team should be mindful that in a governance 2.0 setting the community would be responsible for future top-ups. Therefore, it would be prudent to institute mechanisms for easily justifying requests for funding and then reporting on success factors. Wagmedia is a first mover, but other contenders will join over time; our system needs to be able to adapt and maintain consistently high standards.

Everything does not need to be rewarded. The team needs to plan their goals for the spend period, this can be done by identifying ecosystem needs, converting this to specific rewards and then prioritizing these items. Everything is not a priority either, and in their proposed role, Wagmedia needs to discern value as an agent of the treasury.

The team can then set these as sub-bounties with fixed rewards. We don't need to grossly enrich recipients, there should be some gratification by the act itself and an acknowledgement that quality work product will be noticed by project teams and other non-community subsidized for-profit ventures. Suggestions for spending or translation should be noted and if seen as a priority be included in the next request for funding.

To cover unforeseen expenditure the team can implement a contingency and report on its use with their request for future funding.
Wagmedia's directors do a fair share of work and they deserve to be paid. I believe that the curator's fee should be explicitly broken down and used to cover their fees as an 'administrative expense'.

I suggest that Wagmedia’s tipping mechanism be used as a system to encourage users to migrate to sub-bounties/proposals. With the current design, tips are a low friction way to earn KSM. It can generate more income than an actual spending proposal by submitting many low-effort/low-quality items.  

One suggestion to create a self-enforcing quality control mechanism would be for tips to be rewarded with $CHRWNA. If a contributor wants to attain a sub-bounty or submit a proposal they must transfer a quantity of $CHRWNA to the bounty account. The amount of $CHRWNA could be proportional to the KSM being requested.

If someone does not have sufficient $CHRWNA but wants to fulfil a sub-bounty they could engage the Wagmedia community for funding, participate in tippable content to build their reserves or form an independent team to achieve same. The content generated by tips would also act as a basis of review.

$CHRWNA was used as an example but if the team is open to the idea they may adopt a new token or other structure to achieve the same community-input/filtering objective.

The team should work on KPIs or statistics to reflect the output that they were able to attain per $ and the outreach content was able to achieve. The team should also report on the number of complaints and provide reference to its details. The community can use these statistics to vote for further funding of the bounty.

I want to support Wagmedia.  I also have a responsibility to support all of Kusama, and ensure careful oversight of treasury funds. Personally, I believe that if some of the aforementioned concepts are addressed or implemented, the Wagmedia proposal can be very effective to generate quality content with a clear return on investment and broad-based community support.
