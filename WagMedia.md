Dear community,

Having had the opportunity to review feedback from both sides I would like to provide some further feedback of my own.

In Wagmedia's own words, the Wagmedia team embarked on an experiment to `Solve the Dotsama information distribution problem`.  The team planned to achieve this by providing incentives to individual participants, to create comprehensive, useful and inspiring content.

It is in my opinion that Wagmedia has done a good job of:

1.  Assembling teams to produce community generated content
2.  Developing an agile system of rewarding content

This is weighed against concerns raised by some members of the community. These are, by title:

1.  Capital efficiency
2.  Quality of content
3.  Market reach
4.  Centralization of authority
5.  Code of Conduct
6.  Management of funds
7.  Effects on the wider market
   
At the onset of community discussion my initial concerns surrounded spending allocations.  The team requested 25,000 KSM /6 months, lending towards a 50,000 KSM annual budget.  Pro-rating 2022 inflation earnings, Kusama's treasury earns about 205,000 KSM with 41,600 KSM burnt annually.  Considering that there are other areas of expenditure and token burns, **a 50,000 KSM annual budget is not sustainable**.

 I believe there is room for a budget allocation for community generated content. Wagmedia is the only contender and the pioneer in the space.  I believe that there are inadequacies with Wagmedia's current model and I would like to speak to some of these and conclude with a suggestion.

 The foregoing are my general thoughts after independent reviews and following up on community feedback.  I haven't reviewed every rewarded item but I am confident with my statements.

### 1) Capital efficiency

The team does a better job of reviewing spending proposals but pricing in many cases are higher than market rates, in some cases 3-4x.  

Tips are rewarded liberally, the magnitude of each reward is smaller but the numbers tally to a large expenditure.  Tips based content comprises the majority of the budget.

### 2) Quality of Content

The quality of output from spending proposals are notably higher than those attained from tips.  As it relates to dubbing, I question the NEED of some items.  Is a 2017 video by Rob on interoperability required or is it now superseded?  

I agree with community sentiment that the quality of some tips leave a lot to be desired.

### 3) Market Reach

Content generated from spending proposals are noticeably higher than tips.  In the case of tips, some items were rewarded with < 10 views.  I agree that brands take time to build but keep the section above in mind.

### 4) Centralization of authority

Spending proposals appear to be reviewed by a team whereas tips are rewarded by **a single director** per genre.  Considering that there are no quotas involved, a single individual can have spend authority of significant amounts of funds.

### 5) Code of conduct

A view was shared that recipients of bounty funds may be perceived as official voices of the network.  There was another concern raised that a funded series spoke negatively towards their project citing incorrect facts.

I believe that there should be:

-   A documented disclaimer to disassociate the views expressed by the presenter with the relay-chain/parity/w3f
-   Code of conduct - There should be standards that prevent using derogatory slurs, inflammatory comments and reporting on nonfactual information. 
-   A mechanism for submitting complaints, a method for their evaluation and establishing penalties. 

I believe these should be industry standards that one can copy/paste.  The goal is not to censor but to keep content to a professional level of reporting.

### 6) Management of funds

- Funding disbursed from the treasury should be sent directly to contributors as KSM and not via De-Fi based chains.  If a user has a particular need for De-Fi they should satisfy this themselves.
- The treasury should not responsible for paying any items that are deemed "pending".  KSM allocations should have ceased when bounty funding was depleted.
- It would be good for the community to also see the payments received by person.  If this information is available please publish or direct me to it.


### 7) Effects on the wider market

Wagmedia's use of treasury funds to pay premium prices for work with lower barriers to entry has an impact on the wider market.  Content creators are now charging higher rates for their work and may not be encouraged to fill positions on dotjobs.com.  This deprives parachain teams of resources or in the least increases their operating costs.

### Suggestions

The team should be mindful that in a governance 2.0 setting the community would be responsible for future top-ups.  One would be prudent to institute mechanisms for easily justifying requests for funding and then reporting on success factors.  Wagmedia has first mover advantage but other contenders will join over time.

Everything does not need to be rewarded with KSM.  The team needs to plan their goals for the spend period, this can be done by identifying ecosystem needs, converting this to specific items and prioritizing these items.  Everything is not a priority either.

The team can then set these as `sub-bounties` with fixed rewards.  We don't need to grossly enrich recipients, there should be some gratification by the act itself.  Suggestions for spending or translation should be noted and if seen as a priority be included in the next request for funding. 

To cover unforeseen expenditure the team can implement a contingency and report on its use with their request for future funding.  

Wagmedia's directors do a fair share of work.  I believe that the curator's fee should be used to cover their fees as an 'administrative expense'.

I sincerely believe that Wagmedia's tipping system is the source of many of the concerns raised by the community.  The suggested idea of tiers may ultimately fail as some of the poor quality content was submitted by 'senior' members of the Wagmedia.

I suggest that Wagmedia's tipping mechanism be used as a system to encourage users to migrate to sub-bounties/proposals.  With the current design, tips are a low friction way to earn KSM.  It can generate more income than a proposal by submitting many low-effort/low-quality items.   

Tips should be rewarded with $CHRWNA.  If a contributor wants to attain a sub-bounty or submit a proposal they must transfer a quantity of $CHRWNA to the bounty account.  The amount of $CHRWNA should be proportional to the KSM being requested.

If someone does not have sufficient $CHRWNA but wants to fulfil a sub-bounty they could engage the Wagmedia community for funding or participate in tippable content to build their reserves.  The content generated by tips also acts as a basis of review.  

 $CHRWNA was used as an example but if the team is open to the idea they may adopt a new token.

 The team should work on KPIs or statistics to reflect the output that they were able to attain per $ and the outreach content was able to achieve.  The team should also report on the number of complaints and provide reference to its details.  The community can use these statistics to vote for further funding of the bounty.  

 I believe if the aforementioned is implemented the bounty request can be significantly reduced, quality would be improved and criticism would decrease.

 Best Regards,
